News Site Project

This is a project I started yesterday in which I look to excercise many of the topics I've learned over the last couple of months.
In a way, this will be the first site I ever code top to bottom and start to finish. I first wrote the HTML structure and then gave
it a crude design using CSS. Then I improved on the overall look and the responsiveness of the site. There are many things left to do
still. My intent with this project is to be able to excercise many of the technologies I learned from May up until now.
